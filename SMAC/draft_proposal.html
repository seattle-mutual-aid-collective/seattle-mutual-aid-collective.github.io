    <section class="intro">
        <p>The City of Seattle recognizes the need for community-led resilience initiatives that strengthen connections between neighbors and communities. The Seattle Office of Emergency Management and the Department of Neighborhoods support active development of new projects establishing Community Emergency Hubs for short-term crisis response and Resilience Hubs for long-term organization of community wellbeing.</p>
        
        <p>The Seattle Mutual Aid Collective is a community organization working on enhancing local resilience efforts and strengthening support networks for vulnerable community members. We are a queer and trans-operated group focusing on delivering mutual aid connections and resources to socially vulnerable individuals who face barriers in accessing neighborhood resilience resources due to geographic, social, or economic isolation.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        
        <p>This proposal seeks funding from the Neighborhood Matching Fund for a comprehensive Emergency Communications and Resilience Workshop Series, with practical skills, training and resources that will be put to concrete use through the establishment of complementary Community Emergency Communications and Resilience Hubs.</p>
        
        <p>Our project addresses a critical community need by creating resilience pathways both within neighborhoods and across Seattle's diverse communities. By strengthening connections between isolated individuals and established neighborhood structures, we build a more robust citywide emergency response network that leaves no one behind.</p>
        
        <p>We are supported by community interest and engagement, with 10 volunteers pledging their time and expertise to this proposal. These community members bring diverse skills in emergency preparedness, communications technology, and community organizing.</p>

            <li>Implementation following City and State guidelines for creating interconnected Resilience Hubs</li>

            <li>Resource directory specifically designed for vulnerable neighbors who may not be connected to traditional neighborhood networks</li>
            <li>Ongoing support structure to maintain connections between emergency events</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By focusing both on emergency communications and long-term resilience, this project creates multiple pathways for community members to engage with emergency preparedness while strengthening the social fabric that supports vulnerable populations before, during, and after crisis events.</p>
