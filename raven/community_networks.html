                    <p>Seattle faces escalating climate and seismic risks that disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. Our project addresses documented gaps in disaster preparedness infrastructure:</p>
                    
                    <p>Nearly <span class="highlight">50% of Seattle's low-income households</span> lack emergency kits or plans, and over <span class="highlight">two-thirds of non-English speakers</span> report no disaster readiness strategy. These gaps create serious vulnerabilities in our community's resilience.</p>
                    
                    <p>RAVEN directly benefits the community by:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating a new registered <span class="highlight">Seattle Emergency Communications Hub</span> that will serve as a critical node in the city's disaster response network. This hub will provide communications capabilities even when traditional infrastructure fails, ensuring that isolated communities maintain connection to vital resources and information.</li>
                        
                        <li>Providing <span class="emphasis">free, accessible workshops</span> on emergency communications, preparedness, and climate resilience that will reach 200+ residents. All activities will be open to the public regardless of background, language, or ability.</li>
                        
                        <li>Distributing over <span class="highlight">100 emergency kits</span> to vulnerable households, with priority given to individuals who face barriers to acquiring these resources independently.</li>
                        
                        <li>Establishing <span class="emphasis">weekly community breakfasts</span> at Cal Anderson Park that combine emergency planning with relationship building, creating sustainable connections that transcend emergency situations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Our project aligns with the Seattle Office of Emergency Management's strategic goals while extending their reach to communities often missed by traditional outreach. By strengthening connections between isolated individuals and established neighborhood structures, we build a more robust citywide emergency response network that leaves no one behind.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Community Involvement</h2>
                    <p>RAVEN is fundamentally community-driven, shaped by collaborative partnerships and designed to engage diverse participants from planning through implementation.</p>

                    <p>Our community engagement strategy includes multiple pathways for participation:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emphasis">Multi-channel outreach</span> – Utilizing social media, community bulletins, partner networks, and in-person outreach at neighborhood events.

                        <li><span class="emphasis">Regular community presence</span> – Weekly breakfast events provide consistent, low-barrier opportunities for community members to engage with emergency planning in a social context.</li>
                        
                        <li><span class="emphasis">Skills-based workshops</span> – Offering specific training opportunities that build community capacity while addressing practical emergency needs.</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Community members have shaped this project from its inception, with feedback from diverse stakeholders informing our workshop topics, outreach strategies, and resource distribution priorities.</p>
